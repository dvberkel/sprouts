Sprouts
=======

I recently read the article
[Computer Analysis of Sprouts With Nimbers](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2320 "ArXiv entry 1008.2320")
by Julien Lemoine and Simon Viennot. I studied the game of
[sprouts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_%28game%29 "Wikipedia on Sprouts")
before and was interested to follow the line of thought.

Environment
-----------

We use python to perform our computations. Allowing python to see
the project by adding the current directory to the `PYTHONPATH`.
